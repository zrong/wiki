`TED演讲：知名主持人分享高情商聊天的十大技巧 <https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1330129726850514944>`_

1. 专心聊天，活在当下。
2. 别好为人师，倾听别人的观点。
3. 开放式问题，给对方更多回答空间。
    参照记者提问的方式：who、when、how、why、where。如果你询问一个复杂问题，你会得到一个简单的回答。人们会参照你问句中的那个最有力量的词给出回答。你问「你熟悉这个技术吗？」他会说「是的，我很熟悉。」然后你不得不想出更多问题来询问他。
4. 顺其自然，表达你心中的想法。
5. 实事求是，不知为不知。
6. 在对方谈论自己时，不要用自己的经历去类比别人。
7. 不要重复相同的事情。
8. 少说废话，在非专业交流中，对方关心的是彼此而不是无用的细节。
9. 认真倾听，为理解对方而倾听，而非为回应！。
10. 简明扼要。

对他人发自内心产生兴趣，每个人都有与众不同的一面，发现他们的魅力之处并为之惊叹，总会有所收获！

1. Be present , Be in that moment
2. Assume that you have sth. to learn
3. Use opening questions. If u put it into a complicated question , u will get a simple answer out. “Were you terrify?” “Were you angry?””What was that like?””How did that feel?”
4. Let them come and let them go.
5. If you don’t know, say it. Talk should not be cheap.
6. Don’t equip your experience with theirs. It’s not the same. It is never the same. All their experiences are individual, And more importantly it is not about you. You don’t need take that moment to prove how amazing you are, or how much you suffered .
7. Try not repeat yourself.
8. Forget about the details, the year the names…leave them out. What they caring about is you. What’s you like. What’s you have in common.
9. Listen.(We get distracted，The average person talks about 225 words per min. But we can listen add up to 500 words per min, So our minds are fill in those other 275 words.)”Most of us don’t listen with intend to understand . We listen with intend to reply
10. Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.

Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and most importantly , be prepared to be amazed.

金句：

Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.
