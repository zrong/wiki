格言警句
==================

I am not in this world to live up to other people's expectations, nor do i fell that the world must live up to mine.

我来到这个世界，补充来满足他人的期望的，也不觉得这个世界必须要满足我的期望。

-- Fritz Perls


Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment.

  * I believe in the sun, even when it's no shining.
  * I believe in love, even when I'm alone.
  * I believe in God, even when He is silent.

You’re not your job. You’re not how much money you have in the bank. You’re not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You’re not your fucking khakis. You’re the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. 

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. (Mark Twain)

Life is made up of small pleasures.

Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous mind.

在喧闹而奔忙的世界中平静地往前走 
这是多么和平、安宁 
你要与周围地所有的人友好相处 
尽可能不要放弃这种努力和追求 
你要轻轻却要清晰地说出自己地真实思想 
并且耐心倾听别人含糊甚至烦人的想法 
因为每个人都有他们自己的故事 
你要远远避开那些吵闹、具有侵略性的人 
他们会使你的精神痛苦 
如果你将自己与他人作比 
那么你将变得既自负又痛苦 
因为这世上永远有着比你强和比你弱的人们 
你该享受你自己的成就和计划 
保持对你自己的事业的兴趣 
它们不管多么细琐、低下，都是你 
在变化多端的时代能真正拥有的财产 
在商业事务中你要小心谨慎 
这世上到处都有阴谋和欺骗 
你也不要让自己对美德视而不见 
世界上很多人为了崇高的理想在忍饥挨饿 
生活中到处都有英雄主义存在 
你对你自己要诚实 
尤其不要无情装有情 
对爱情不要玩世不恭 
在这干旱、没有希望的土地上 
它是一片四季常青的绿洲 
你要认真吸取流水年华的经验 
从容地向青春时光告别 
你要培养自己的精神力量 
以抗击突如其来的不幸的打击 
但你千万不要用想象使自己苦恼、忧伤 
有很多恐惧产生于疲劳和孤独 
除去有益于身心健康的原则之外 
你要善待你自己 
你和树林、星星一样是这茫茫宇宙的一分子 
你有权力生活在这里 
毫无疑问这世界已经完全为你打开 
所以你要与上帝和平相处 
不论你觉得他身在何方 
也不论你作出何种努力、有什么渴望 
在喧闹、混杂的生活中 
你应该与你的心灵和平相处 
尽管这世上有很多假冒和欺骗 
有很多单调乏味的工作 
和众多破灭的梦幻 
它仍然是一个美好的世界 
记住：你应该努力去追求幸福

1692年镌刻于 巴尔的摩圣保罗教堂

Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant, they too have their story. 

Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

Keep interested in your own career, however humble, it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in face of sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

With all its sham, drudgery & broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.
